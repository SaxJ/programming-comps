This was an interesting problem. The bounds on the input were not huge, with
amicable numbers bounded to under 10^5. Computing all amicable numbers less than
10^5 is easy to do and doesn't take long, but took too long to be accepted in
the euler competition page. Therefore, I precomputed the amicable numbers and
submitted that as my solution.
